## Synthesis plan

We will conduct an individual participant data meta-analysis, by modelling a Bayesian, beta-binomial hierarchical regression. Our effect size will be presented as odds ratio between baseline and intervention phase, which represents the trend and variability aspects of SCED analysis according to WWC guidelines. The analyses will be performed in R (R Core Team, 2023; R version 4.3.1), using the brms (@burknerBrmsPackageBayesian2017) package, an R wrapper for the probabilistic programming language Stan (Stan Development Team, 2024). \
We will conduct separate analyses for each category of reading interventions, as we do not consider them conceptually homogeneous enough to aggregate in one model. Likewise, we will group the analyses based on designs that can be synthesized in the same model. \
In the first group, we will aggregate multiple baseline (and its variants), multiple probe designs. We consider these designs similar in logic, and as long as the intervention and outcome are kept homogeneous, we can model the variations in measurement and intervention setup across stages as random variation. \
In the second group, we will synthesise changing-criterion designs. We will model CC designs according to the same formula as multiple baseline/AB designs, but separately from those designs. This aligns with the suggested analytical approach by  @shadishAnalyzingDataSingleCase2013, which suggested an analytical approach where one regards all criterion phases as the intervention phase and compares to the baseline (ignoring the stabilizing phases between criterions). Although modelling the CC design this way would functionally make it comparable to multiple baseline/AB design setup, the staggered nature of CC designs might artificially flatten the slope compared to AB or multiple baseline designs, where the mastery of the final desired outcome may come immediately, or at least early in the intervention phase. \

The third group will consist of multiple-treatment designs, including multi-element designs, alternating-treatment designs, adapted alternating-treatment designs, and simultaneous-treatment designs. For studies using an Alternating Treatment Design (ATD), we will follow a structured extraction workflow: First, we will verify that a baseline phase is present, either as a pre-intervention phase or a comparison phase without treatment. If no baseline is available, the study will be excluded from extraction. If a baseline is present, we will assess the treatment phases. If both treatments do not belong to the same intervention category, the study will not be included in the analysis. Studies without a baseline/no treatment condition or comparing different intervention categories would not answer our research question which does not focus on the relative effectiveness of interventions. The baseline data will be explicitly modeled as "Baseline," and the superior treatment data will be modeled as "Intervention," extracting all available points. In all cases, data extraction will be done sequentially to maintain the chronological order of sessions in the dataset. These analyses follow modelling alternatives suggested by @manolovMetaanalysisSinglecaseExperimental2023a and @moeyaertEstimatingInterventionEffects2015a, based on the decision trees driven by the research question.\

If we happen to find alternating/reversal phase designs (i.e., AB designs), we will aggregate them in the fourth group, although due to the nature of the intervention (learning effects), we do not expect to include these designs. \

We will not model interventions categorized as other as we expect that category to be overly heterogeneous. 

With four groups based on design, and three interventions (phonological awareness, fluency, and phonics), we anticipate at most 12 main meta-analytic models, given that we find at least two eligible studies for each category. Table 2 illustrates possible combinations and designs we plan to synthesise together.

We will model the baseline and intervention phase separately in our main meta-analysis model, with interaction with time (session). We will also not model autocorrelation. Although the literature suggests the existence of moderate autocorrelation, particularly in multiple-baseline designs (@shadishCharacteristicsSinglecaseDesigns2011), we could model it exploratory only due to unknown estimates. 

To answer our research question, we will provide posterior distribution plots of the average intervention effect (fixed effect) and the interaction effect between session and intervention. Furthermore, we will plot the posterior distributions of the random-effects estimates (SD) to assess heterogeneity of intervention effects between studies, and between participants within studies. We will provide estimates with 90% credible intervals for each effect, allowing readers to understand both the average intervention impact and the variability of effects across different studies and participants. As estimates will be presented on a log-odds scale, we will supplement them with converted odds ratios for interpretability.

Level one of the multilevel model describes the relationship between the outcome - word or non-word reading, and the predictor - reading intervention. Informed by previous reviews with similar interest, we assume majority of the studies will employ non-standardized word-reading tests, with counts and percentages as measures, and fixed word lists, as we assume the existence of autocorrelation (but will not model it explicitly) and knowledge transfer, we cannot assume the trials are independent. To allow for greater flexibility and account for over-dispersion (i.e., variance being larger than the mean), and to account for unavailable raw counts in instances where the studies present proportion of correct responses, we will model the outcome under the beta-binomial distribution (@gelmanBayesianDataAnalysis2020). Figure 1 illustrates the multiple levels in a meta-analysis.

To calculate the effect for our meta-analysis, we need to account for clusters on the levels we specified in the beginning: participant and study. There are two ways to approach when we have raw data - calculate average effects per study and do a meta-analysis of those effects (which is the common way of conducting a meta-analysis when you don't have raw data) or build a model that directly calculates the population (average) effect from the raw data. We will do the latter, one stage approach.

**Figure 1**
![Levels of the hierarchical model in SCEDs](MA SCED model.png)

Thus, our starting model is as follows:

$$
Y_{ijk} \sim BetaBin(N_{ijk}, \mu_{ijk}, \theta)
$$ 

Beta-binomial distribution can be explained as a binomial distribution that has its probability parameter informed by the beta distribution of probabilities. $Y_{ijk}$ represents the correct response rate for each individual (j) within a study (k) at a certain time point i = 1, ..., n. $BetaBin$ indicates the observations are drawn from a beta-binomial distribution which has the $N_{ijk}$ parameter for the number of trials, $\mu_{ijk}$ for the average probability (Some authors denote it as pbar; @mcelreathStatisticalRethinkingBayesian2020) of the beta distribution and $\theta$ as the dispersion (precision) parameter of the beta distribution (some authors might note it as $\phi$; @burknerBrmsPackageBayesian2017). 

$$
\text{logit}(\mu_{ijk}) = \alpha + \beta_1 ID_{j} + \beta_2 \text{session}_{i} + \beta_3 ID_j*\text{session}_{i} + g_{jk} + g_k
$$

Here, $\alpha$ is the global intercept, $\beta_1$ represents the main effect of ID (i.e., design phase), $\beta_2$ represents the main effect of session (i.e., measurement occasions), $\beta_3 ID_j*session_i$ represents the interaction of session and phase, $g_{jk}$ is the participant-level random effect nested within the study, $g_k$ is the study-level random effect. The ID stands for phase, and will be either baseline and intervention in case of AB, multiple baseline and changing criterion designs, or baseline, intervention 1 and intervention 2 for eligible alternating treatment designs.

Next parameters we have to specify for the Bayesian model would be the priors for the distribution parameters.We take the first function and add a prior for the average probability parameter ($\mu$) which is a log odds probability of success ($\alpha_{treatment[i]}$), with the $treatment$ index implying whether it's baseline or intervention. We draw the $\alpha$ from a normal distribution with a $mean$ of 0 and $SD$ of 1.5. The choice of the distribution is relatively arbitrary, we can assume that the odds parameter can be drawn from a normal distribution, but parameters are up to us to define based on previous knowledge.

The multilevel model now specifies random effects on the participant ($g_{j}$) and study level ($g_{k}$). We also define parameters for priors for the means and standard deviations. As these effects are interdependent, the model also produces a correlation matrix to explain the covariance. Weakly informative priors drawn from a Student-t or a Cauchy distribution have been recommended by @gelmanPriorDistributionsVariance2006 for hierarchical models, particularly when the number of groups is larger than 3, which we expect in our meta-analyses. Suggested informative priors come from @grekovFlexibleDistributionalModels2025. Although the priors they specified fit the baseline phase only, while we also include the intervention phase, the data is highly similar to our targeted data, as they modelled reading fluency outcomes from single-case designs.

Furthermore, we will incorporate immediate level changes and time trends through session effects and their interaction with the phases. This allows us to capture both the immediate difference and gradual changes happening during the intervention/baseline phase. The model includes random slopes for both session and intervention × session effects at both study and case levels, enabling us to detect heterogeneity in learning trajectories across studies and participants.

LKJ, the Lewandowski-Kurowicka-Joe distribution is a probability distribution over positive-definite symmetric matrices with unit diagonals, i.e., correlation matrices (@gelmanBayesianDataAnalysis2020). We use this distribution as a prior for the correlation matrix of effects in the model and set it as $LKJcorr(2)$ of 2, which makes extreme correlations less likely in the correlation matrix, but still allows for correlations between the effects (@mcelreathStatisticalRethinkingBayesian2020).\

We draw standard deviations from the half-student-t distributions, instead of normal, as it allows the possibility of extreme (tail) values, which helps us accommodate to uncertainty of these values. By defining it as "half", we constrain the distribution only to positive values for the SD.\

Given the way that the designs are bounding the possible answers to a small range, and often conduct interventions until 100% success rate is achieved, we can expect ceiling effects, large effects in the intervention phase and larger improvements (slope) for those with lower baseline results.\

The hierarchical structure of the random effects follows:

$$
g_{jk} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_{j[k]})
$$

$$
g_k \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_{k})
$$

where $g_{jk}$ represents variability among cases within studies, $g_{k}$ stands for variability across studies, $\sigma_{j[k]}$ and $\sigma_{k}$ are the standard deviations at each level.

The variance components follow a hierarchical prior:

$$
\sigma_{k} \sim \text{Half-Student}(3, 0, 2.5)
$$

$$
\sigma_{j[k]} \sim \text{Half-Student}(3, 0, 2.5)
$$

$$
\mathbf{R} \sim LKJcorr(2)
$$


$$
\alpha \sim \text{Student}(3, 3.9, 2.5)
$$

$$
\beta_1, \beta_2, \beta_3 \sim \text{Student}(3, 0, 2.5)
$$


$$
\theta = \Phi
$$ 

$$
\Phi \sim gamma(1,1)
$$

### Moderator analysis

We will conduct a moderator analysis based on IQ, as findings by @allorScientificallyBasedReading2014 suggest that lower IQ is linked to lower rates of reading development. Given the way that the designs are bounding the possible answers to a small range, and often conduct interventions until 100% success rate is achieved, we can expect ceiling effects, large effects in the intervention phase and larger improvements (slope) for those with lower baseline results. \
We will introduce IQ as a continuous predictor in the main model, centered around the group mean. While grand-mean centering might be appropriate given that it is one population of participants, in this case, group-mean centering is preferable due to the likely non-random selection of intellectual disability (ID) severity within studies (@kreftEffectDifferentForms1995, @endersCenteringPredictorVariables2007). Specifically, the selection of participants with a particular severity level (e.g., mild intellectual disability) may influence the intervention complexity. If IQ were centered around the grand mean, this study-level selection bias could distort estimates, making group-mean centering a more appropriate choice to account for within-study variability. 

$$
\text{logit}(\mu_{ijk}) = \alpha + \beta_1 ID_{j} + \beta_2 \text{session}_{i} + \beta_3 ID_j*\text{session}_{i} + g_{jk} + g_k + \gamma_{IQ[j]}
$$
$$
\gamma_{IQ[j]} \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_{IQ[j]}, \sigma_{IQ[j]})
$$

We will include IQ as a continuous variable rather than using categorical ID severity, as a continuous measure provides more granular and informative modeling of variation. Additionally, there are potentially two types of missing values:\

Missing at random --- where IQ scores are either not reported or not permitted for sharing. \
Missing not at random --- where IQ scores are unavailable because participants could not be reliably tested due to the severity of their disability.

If the data is not missing at random, we will not conduct a moderator analysis. In case of an MAR type missingness, we will impute the values with the mice package (@mice).

## Model building workflow

We have pre-specified possible alternatives for the models, based on assumptions about the outcome data and intervention characteristics. However, as we do not have data at the moment of specifying the models, we propose a workflow to determine which model will be selected as the main model once we obtain the data.

We will graphically inspect the data to estimate the growth curve based on sessions, to determine whether time influences the outcome linearly or exponentially. 

Table 3 presents alternate priors and functions of the predictors that we will apply to the data and test the model fit. We will select the best model for each meta-analysis as the main model and provide results of the other model alternatives as a sensitivity analysis.

The draws are sampled from a sample dataset of single case designs with a proportion outcome, but in a different subject, for purposes of building and testing the model before collecting real data.

### Step 3 - Model Comparisons (LOO and WAIC)
We will conduct leave-one-out cross validation, and its expansion, the Watanabe-Aikake (widely applicable; WAIC) information criterion, to select the best fitted model for the meta-analysis. Based on @gelmanUnderstandingPredictiveInformation2014, LOO and WAIC are more appropriate for partial or complete pooling models. Interpretation will be done based on the WAIC and LOO scores, with the lowest out-of-sample deviance being the criteria for selecting the best fitting model.


```{r}
#| label: model-comparison
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Model comparison code"
fit1_ic <- add_criterion(fit1, criterion = "loo")
fit1_waic <- waic(fit1)
fit2_ic <- add_criterion(fit2, criterion = "loo")
fit2_waic <- waic(fit2)
fit3_ic <- add_criterion(fit3, criterion = "loo")
fit3_waic <- waic(fit3)
fit4_ic <- add_criterion(fit4, criterion = "loo")
fit4_waic <- waic(fit4)

w <- loo_compare(fit1_waic, fit2_waic, fit3_waic, fit4_waic) 
print(w, simplify = F)

l <- loo_compare(fit1_ic, fit2_ic, fit3_ic, fit4_ic) # leave-one-out cross validation
print(l, simplify = F)

```


### Step 4 - Moderator Analysis

```{r}
#| label: model-iq
#| code-fold: TRUE
#| code-summary: "Moderator analysis code"
# we will center IQ with group mean and model with random slopes
imp <- mice(data = data, m = 10, print = FALSE) #im
long_imp <- complete(imp, action='long', include=TRUE)
long_imp <- long_imp %>% mutate(IQ_gpm = ave(IQ, study), IQ_gpc = IQ - IQ_gpm)
imp2 <- as.mids(long_imp)

formula_iq <- bf(success_rate|trials(success_rate + fail_rate) ~ session + ID + session:ID + IQ (1 + session + ID + IQ | study/case))

prior_iq <- get_prior(formula = formula_iq, 
                   data = data, 
                   family = beta_binomial())

fit_iq <- brm_multiple(formula = formula_iq, 
                 data = imp2, 
                 family = beta_binomial(link = "logit"),
                 prior = prior_iq, 
                 warmup = 1000, iter = 4000,
                 cores = parallel::detectCores(),
                 adapt_delta = 0.99
          )

summary(fit_iq)

# posterior predictive check for baseline and intervention fit
pp_check(fit_iq, type = "dens_overlay_grouped", group = "ID", ndraws = 100)

plot(fit_iq)
```


### Step 5 - Risk of Bias sensitivity analysis
```{r}

# do a sensitivity analysis based on risk of bias assessment
# data_rob <- data %>% filter(rob != "high")
```

### Step 5 - Visualization
